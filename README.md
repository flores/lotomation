# WAT

Just sharing the wins and fails while I play with automation.

Mostly just [NinjaBlocks](https://github.com/ninjablocks) Kickstarter board 
(v0.1), which is a BeagleBoard with a nice API, and their libs for now.  But
may get my Arduino and Raspberry Pi into it, too.

Adding 433 MHz devices.  Have motion sensor, power outlets, doormat, and 
various remote controls to start.
